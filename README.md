# Top-Down-Base

Made ~2020

This repository contains two different basic movement templates for a top-down game in Love2D. 
One has standard movement, the other has vector movement with velocity and friction.

These were both intended to be used as a base to start a more complex project.

To run, install Love2D and run the .love file. Use WASD to move.
